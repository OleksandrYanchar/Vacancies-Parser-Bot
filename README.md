![picture alt](scrap_example1.png)

Welcome to the Vacancies Parser Telegram Bot, which helps monitor vacancies for Python developers on three popular websites in Ukraine (Work.ua, Jooble.org, and Jobs.dou.ua). This project is designed using Aiogram, a leading framework for the Telegram Bot API, requests, and bs4 libraries to scrape websites looking for vacancies, and Celery to optimize resource usage.

### Features

#### 1. Scraping:
Just use the /scrap command, and the bot will send you
all the vacancies it found on these websites that
are suitable for Python/backend junior/trainee developers.

#### 2. Get ID:
This command is for people who want to know their
Telegram ID to add it to the .env file and receive messages
or just for themselves.
